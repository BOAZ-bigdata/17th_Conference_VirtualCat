## Introduction
```
üòº We will make a childhood image of the cat for you who adopted an abandoned cat!
```  
### Background of topic
Recently, pet shops have emerged as a big social problem in the concept of buying and selling living things for money.  
If a cat is adopted from an abandoned cat center, there are no childhood photos of the cat!  

### Project Objectives
Encouraging adoption of abandoned cats

## Problem Definition
- The cat's species must not change.
- The resulting product should resemble the cat in the input image.
- The result should look young.

Considering the above problems ,  
various experiments were conducted with various models to transform Cat into kitten.  

## Environment
- OS : Ubuntu 18.04 or Colab
- GPU : Tesla V100-32GB

## Data Preparation
- Web crawling ([Crawler](https://github.com/BOAZ-bigdata/17th_Conference_AntiAginGAN-for-Cat/tree/main/utils/crawler))  
- Resizing images to 256*256  
- Image cleaning ([Cleaner](https://github.com/BOAZ-bigdata/17th_Conference_AntiAginGAN-for-Cat/tree/main/utils/cleaner))

## StyleMixing
Disentangled features can be identified through the result that changes according to the layer being swapped.

## Conclusion
We created a kitten generate model through the Stylegan2-ada model.  
We explored the latent space to find a latent vector that affects a specific feature.  
Using this vector, the projected late vector was further adjusted to generate the desired image.
